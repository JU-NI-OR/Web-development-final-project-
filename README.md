# 💨 VapeDeals Hub

**VapeDeals Hub** is a clean, modern vape product showcase built as a **frontend-only MVP** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's tailored for **South African students and small resellers**, helping them quickly compare vape brands, puff counts, and prices — all without having to jump across multiple stores.

> **“Find the puff that fits your pocket.”**
