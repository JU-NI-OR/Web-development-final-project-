# VapeDeals Hub

## Overview

VapeDeals Hub is a responsive and user-friendly vape product showcase website. It was built as a frontend-only MVP (Minimum Viable Product) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The platform is designed to help users discover affordable and trusted vape products, with direct links to external shops or purchase platforms.

This project targets South African students and small resellers who want to compare puff counts, prices, and brands without having to search multiple stores.

- "Buy Now" buttons linking to external sources (e.g., Amazon, WhatsApp)
- Linked images hosted online (no local uploads necessary)
